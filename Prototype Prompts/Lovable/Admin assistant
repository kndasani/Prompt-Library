First prompt:
I am trying to create an interactive quick start app for a SaaS company where the customers (system admin and business stakeholders) will be asked a few questions like what work is done in the org and how is it tracked today etc to get a sense of which plugins and applications should be enabled for example: if they do work in terms of project then project management if agile then agile apps. The quickstart should then check to see if the customer has licenses and a compatible version of the platform to be able to use all the apps and plugins identified. If yes, trigger installation and configuration flows, if no, then tell them how to get the license and who to talk to. If the verification step is done and installation has been triggered, additional clarifying questions can be asked like how many users, teams should have access, types of project, work hierarchy etc. For the initial questionnaire, use the following questions: 1. What kinds of work or initiatives do you and your team focus on? Helps understand whether they manage projects, programs, ideas, investments, or goals. 2. How do you currently decide which work to prioritize or fund? Reveals how they make decisions and whether they need tools for prioritization, budgeting, or approvals. 3. Who is involved in planning, approving, and tracking progress—and what do they need to see or do? Helps define user roles, responsibilities, and what kind of visibility or reports they need. 4. How do you measure success or progress for your work? Guides the setup of dashboards, KPIs, and performance tracking tools. 5. Are there any tools or systems you already use that you'd like to connect with ServiceNow? Identifies integration needs with tools like Excel, Jira, HR systems, or financial platforms. And for company details pick details like name which can be found in the instance metadata automatically.

//This ask resulted in a broken experience that required further prompting like "can we modify the interface to make conversational so that it looks like we have a digital AI assistant helping us through this?"
Next ask:
can we modify the interface to make conversational so that it looks like we have a digital AI assistant helping us through this?

//It got stuck in a loop and was not progressing to the actual recommendations. Which needed prompting to fix. Just told it that it was stuck at a particular message.
Next ask: Now it's stuck on I'm checking your licenses and platform compatibility to ensure everything will work seamlessly...
Next ask: It's not going to recommendations. clicking show me the plan does not show the plan and goes straight to "congratulations! your servicenow platform is ready"
